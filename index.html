            <h1>Develop <br> Without Limits</h1>
            <p>A coordinated set of learning experiences designed to achieve predetermined outcomes. Program development
                follows a continuum starting with initial environmental scanning and identification of a need or gap;
                determining programming priorities; and the development of learning experiences and application
                activities that culminate in changes in knowledge, behavior, skills and attitudes. These changes
                manifest as measurable program outcomes.</p>

            <p>If you want to grow as a developer, I can't over-emphasize the benefits of joining a developer community.
                There are many advantages, from peer-programming to sharing knowledge, mentorship, sharing support,
                sharing tools, code reviews, answering questions, and much more.</p>

                <h1>Learn Metaverse</span></h1>
                <p>The term "metaverse" was first used by Neil Stevenson in his 1992 novel Snow Crash. The American
                    science fiction writer came up with a world in which real people ran away from the dark reality of
                    the future into colorful virtual worlds. “He is in a computer-generated universe, which his computer
                    draws on his glasses and pumps into his headphones. In the jargon, this imaginary place is known as
                    the Metaverse, "says Neil Stevenson.</p>
